This operation supports conditional HTTP requests.  For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).  To fail if the destination already exists, use a conditional request with If-None-Match: "*".
     *
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @param filesystem The filesystem identifier.
     * @param path The file or directory path.
     * @param resource Required only for Create File and Create Directory. The value must be "file" or "directory". Possible values include: 'directory', 'file'.
     * @param continuation Optional.  When renaming a directory, the number of paths that are renamed with each invocation is limited.  If the number of paths to be renamed exceeds this limit, a continuation token is returned in this response header.  When a continuation token is returned in the response, it must be specified in a subsequent invocation of the rename operation to continue renaming the directory.
     * @param mode Optional. Valid only when namespace is enabled. This parameter determines the behavior of the rename operation. The value must be "legacy" or "posix", and the default value will be "posix". Possible values include: 'legacy', 'posix'.
     * @param cacheControl Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Cache-Control" response header for "Read File" operations for "Read File" operations.
     * @param contentEncoding Optional.  Specifies which content encodings have been applied to the file. This value is returned to the client when the "Read File" operation is performed.
     * @param contentLanguage Optional.  Specifies the natural language used by the intended audience for the file.
     * @param contentDisposition Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Disposition" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsCacheControl Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Cache-Control" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentType Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Type" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentEncoding Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Encoding" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentLanguage Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Language" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentDisposition Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Disposition" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsRenameSource An optional file or directory to be renamed.  The value must have the following format: "/{filesystem}/{path}".  If "x-ms-properties" is specified, the properties will overwrite the existing properties; otherwise, the existing properties will be preserved. This value must be a URL percent-encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set.
     * @param xMsLeaseId Optional.  A lease ID for the path specified in the URI.  The path to be overwritten must have an active lease and the lease ID must match.
     * @param xMsSourceLeaseId Optional for rename operations.  A lease ID for the source path.  The source path must have an active lease and the lease ID must match.
     * @param xMsProperties Optional.  User-defined properties to be stored with the file or directory, in the format of a comma-separated list of name and value pairs "n1=v1, n2=v2, ...", where each value is a base64 encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set.
     * @param xMsPermissions Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.  Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported.
     * @param xMsUmask Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. When creating a file or directory and the parent folder does not have a default ACL, the umask restricts the permissions of the file or directory to be created.  The resulting permission is given by p &amp; ^u, where p is the permission and u is the umask.  For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is 0720.  The default permission is 0777 for a directory and 0666 for a file.  The default umask is 0027.  The umask must be specified in 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766).

For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).  To fail if the destination already exists, use a conditional request with If-None-Match: "*".
     *
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @param filesystem The filesystem identifier.
     * @param path The file or directory path.
     * @param resource Required only for Create File and Create Directory. The value must be "file" or "directory". Possible values include: 'directory', 'file'.
     * @param continuation Optional.  When renaming a directory, the number of paths that are renamed with each invocation is limited.  If the number of paths to be renamed exceeds this limit, a continuation token is returned in this response header.  When a continuation token is returned in the response, it must be specified in a subsequent invocation of the rename operation to continue renaming the directory.
     * @param mode Optional. Valid only when namespace is enabled. This parameter determines the behavior of the rename operation. The value must be "legacy" or "posix", and the default value will be "posix". Possible values include: 'legacy', 'posix'.
     * @param cacheControl Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Cache-Control" response header for "Read File" operations for "Read File" operations.
     * @param contentEncoding Optional.  Specifies which content encodings have been applied to the file. This value is returned to the client when the "Read File" operation is performed.
     * @param contentLanguage Optional.  Specifies the natural language used by the intended audience for the file.
     * @param contentDisposition Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Disposition" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsCacheControl Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Cache-Control" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentType Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Type" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentEncoding Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Encoding" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentLanguage Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Language" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentDisposition Optional.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Disposition" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsRenameSource An optional file or directory to be renamed.  The value must have the following format: "/{filesystem}/{path}".  If "x-ms-properties" is specified, the properties will overwrite the existing properties; otherwise, the existing properties will be preserved. This value must be a URL percent-encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set.
     * @param xMsLeaseId Optional.  A lease ID for the path specified in the URI.  The path to be overwritten must have an active lease and the lease ID must match.
     * @param xMsSourceLeaseId Optional for rename operations.  A lease ID for the source path.  The source path must have an active lease and the lease ID must match.
     * @param xMsProperties Optional.  User-defined properties to be stored with the file or directory, in the format of a comma-separated list of name and value pairs "n1=v1, n2=v2, ...", where each value is a base64 encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set.

Each class may be granted read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.  Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported.
     * @param xMsUmask Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. When creating a file or directory and the parent folder does not have a default ACL, the umask restricts the permissions of the file or directory to be created.  The resulting permission is given by p &amp; ^u, where p is the permission and u is the umask.  For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is 0720.  The default permission is 0777 for a directory and 0666 for a file.  The default umask is 0027.  The umask must be specified in 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766).
     * @param ifMatch Optional.  An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes.

Also note that the Access Control List (ACL) includes permissions for the owner, owning group, and others, so the x-ms-permissions and x-ms-acl request headers are mutually exclusive. Possible values include: 'append', 'flush', 'setProperties', 'setAccessControl'.
     * @param filesystem The filesystem identifier.
     * @param path The file or directory path.
     * @param position This parameter allows the caller to upload data in parallel and control the order in which it is appended to the file.  It is required when uploading data to be appended to the file and when flushing previously uploaded data to the file.  The value must be the position where the data is to be appended.  Uploaded data is not immediately flushed, or written, to the file.  To flush, the previously uploaded data must be contiguous, the position parameter must be specified and equal to the length of the file after all data has been written, and there must not be a request entity body included with the request.
     * @param retainUncommittedData Valid only for flush operations.  If "true", uncommitted data is retained after the flush operation completes; otherwise, the uncommitted data is deleted after the flush operation.  The default is false.  Data at offsets less than the specified position are written to the file when flush succeeds, but this optional parameter allows data after the flush position to be retained for a future flush operation.
     * @param close Azure Storage Events allow applications to receive notifications when files change. When Azure Storage Events are enabled, a file changed event is raised. This event has a property indicating whether this is the final change to distinguish the difference between an intermediate flush to a file stream and the final close of a file stream. The close query parameter is valid only when the action is "flush" and change notifications are enabled. If the value of close is "true" and the flush operation completes successfully, the service raises a file change notification with a property indicating that this is the final update (the file stream has been closed). If "false" a change notification is raised indicating the file has changed. The default is false. This query parameter is set to true by the Hadoop ABFS driver to indicate that the file stream has been closed.".
     * @param contentLength Required for "Append Data" and "Flush Data".  Must be 0 for "Flush Data".  Must be the length of the request content in bytes for "Append Data".
     * @param xMsLeaseId The lease ID must be specified if there is an active lease.
     * @param xMsCacheControl Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Cache-Control" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentType Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Type" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentDisposition Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Disposition" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentEncoding Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Encoding" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentLanguage Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Language" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsProperties Optional.  User-defined properties to be stored with the file or directory, in the format of a comma-separated list of name and value pairs "n1=v1, n2=v2, ...", where each value is a base64 encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set. Valid only for the setProperties operation. If the file or directory exists, any properties not included in the list will be removed.  All properties are removed if the header is omitted.  To merge new and existing properties, first get all existing properties and the current E-Tag, then make a conditional request with the E-Tag and include values for all properties.
     * @param xMsOwner Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owner of the file or directory.
     * @param xMsGroup Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owning group of the file or directory.
     * @param xMsPermissions Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.  Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported. Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-acl.
     * @param xMsAcl Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. The value is a comma-separated list of access control entries that fully replaces the existing access control list (ACL).  Each access control entry (ACE) consists of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format "[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]". The scope must be "default" to indicate the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: "user" grants rights to the owner or a named user, "group" grants rights to the owning group or a named group, "mask" restricts rights granted to named users and the members of groups, and "other" grants rights to all users not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted for entries of type "mask" and "other".  The user or group identifier is also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a 3-character sequence where the first character is 'r' to grant read access, the second character is 'w' to grant write access, and the third character is 'x' to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the '-' character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example, the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to everyone else: "user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask=rwx". Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-permissions.
     * @param ifMatch Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes.
     * @param ifNoneMatch Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value or the special wildcard ("*") value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes.
     * @param ifModifiedSince Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has been modified since the specified date and time.
     * @param ifUnmodifiedSince Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has not been modified since the specified date and time.
     * @param requestBody Valid only for append operations.  The data to be uploaded and appended to the file.
     * @param xMsClientRequestId A UUID recorded in the analytics logs for troubleshooting and correlation.
     * @param timeout An optional operation timeout value in seconds. The period begins when the request is received by the service. If the timeout value elapses before the operation completes, the operation fails.
     * @param xMsDate Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request.  This is required when using shared key authorization.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @throws DataLakeStorageErrorException thrown if the request is rejected by server.
     * @throws RuntimeException all other wrapped checked exceptions if the request fails to be sent.

     * @param filesystem The filesystem identifier.
     * @param path The file or directory path.
     * @param position This parameter allows the caller to upload data in parallel and control the order in which it is appended to the file.  It is required when uploading data to be appended to the file and when flushing previously uploaded data to the file.  The value must be the position where the data is to be appended.  Uploaded data is not immediately flushed, or written, to the file.  To flush, the previously uploaded data must be contiguous, the position parameter must be specified and equal to the length of the file after all data has been written, and there must not be a request entity body included with the request.
     * @param retainUncommittedData Valid only for flush operations.  If "true", uncommitted data is retained after the flush operation completes; otherwise, the uncommitted data is deleted after the flush operation.  The default is false.  Data at offsets less than the specified position are written to the file when flush succeeds, but this optional parameter allows data after the flush position to be retained for a future flush operation.
     * @param close Azure Storage Events allow applications to receive notifications when files change. When Azure Storage Events are enabled, a file changed event is raised. This event has a property indicating whether this is the final change to distinguish the difference between an intermediate flush to a file stream and the final close of a file stream. The close query parameter is valid only when the action is "flush" and change notifications are enabled. If the value of close is "true" and the flush operation completes successfully, the service raises a file change notification with a property indicating that this is the final update (the file stream has been closed). If "false" a change notification is raised indicating the file has changed. The default is false. This query parameter is set to true by the Hadoop ABFS driver to indicate that the file stream has been closed.".
     * @param contentLength Required for "Append Data" and "Flush Data".  Must be 0 for "Flush Data".  Must be the length of the request content in bytes for "Append Data".
     * @param xMsLeaseId The lease ID must be specified if there is an active lease.
     * @param xMsCacheControl Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Cache-Control" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentType Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Type" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentDisposition Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Disposition" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentEncoding Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Encoding" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsContentLanguage Optional and only valid for flush and set properties operations.  The service stores this value and includes it in the "Content-Language" response header for "Read File" operations.
     * @param xMsProperties Optional.  User-defined properties to be stored with the file or directory, in the format of a comma-separated list of name and value pairs "n1=v1, n2=v2, ...", where each value is a base64 encoded string. Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set. Valid only for the setProperties operation. If the file or directory exists, any properties not included in the list will be removed.  All properties are removed if the header is omitted.  To merge new and existing properties, first get all existing properties and the current E-Tag, then make a conditional request with the E-Tag and include values for all properties.
     * @param xMsOwner Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owner of the file or directory.
     * @param xMsGroup Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets the owning group of the file or directory.
     * @param xMsPermissions Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.  Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported. Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-acl.
     * @param xMsAcl Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. The value is a comma-separated list of access control entries that fully replaces the existing access control list (ACL).  Each access control entry (ACE) consists of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format "[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]". The scope must be "default" to indicate the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: "user" grants rights to the owner or a named user, "group" grants rights to the owning group or a named group, "mask" restricts rights granted to named users and the members of groups, and "other" grants rights to all users not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted for entries of type "mask" and "other".  The user or group identifier is also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a 3-character sequence where the first character is 'r' to grant read access, the second character is 'w' to grant write access, and the third character is 'x' to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the '-' character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example, the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to everyone else: "user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask=rwx". Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-permissions.
     * @param ifMatch Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes.
     * @param ifNoneMatch Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data.  An ETag value or the special wildcard ("*") value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes.
     * @param ifModifiedSince Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has been modified since the specified date and time.
     * @param ifUnmodifiedSince Optional for Flush Data and Set Properties, but invalid for Append Data. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has not been modified since the specified date and time.
     * @param requestBody Valid only for append operations.  The data to be uploaded and appended to the file.
     * @param xMsClientRequestId A UUID recorded in the analytics logs for troubleshooting and correlation.
     * @param timeout An optional operation timeout value in seconds. The period begins when the request is received by the service. If the timeout value elapses before the operation completes, the operation fails.
     * @param xMsDate Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request.  This is required when using shared key authorization.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @return a Single which performs the network request upon subscription.

     * Delete File | Delete Directory
     * Delete the file or directory. This operation supports conditional HTTP requests.  For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).
     *
     * @param context The context to associate with this operation.
     * @param filesystem The filesystem identifier.
     * @param path The file or directory path.
     * @param recursive Required and valid only when the resource is a directory.  If "true", all paths beneath the directory will be deleted. If "false" and the directory is non-empty, an error occurs.
     * @param continuation Optional.  When deleting a directory, the number of paths that are deleted with each invocation is limited.  If the number of paths to be deleted exceeds this limit, a continuation token is returned in this response header.  When a continuation token is returned in the response, it must be specified in a subsequent invocation of the delete operation to continue deleting the directory.
     * @param xMsLeaseId The lease ID must be specified if there is an active lease.
     * @param ifMatch Optional.  An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes.
     * @param ifNoneMatch Optional.  An ETag value or the special wildcard ("*") value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified. The ETag must be specified in quotes.
     * @param ifModifiedSince Optional. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has been modified since the specified date and time.
     * @param ifUnmodifiedSince Optional. A date and time value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has not been modified since the specified date and time.
     * @param xMsClientRequestId A UUID recorded in the analytics logs for troubleshooting and correlation.
     * @param timeout An optional operation timeout value in seconds. The period begins when the request is received by the service. If the timeout value elapses before the operation completes, the operation fails.
     * @param xMsDate Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request.  This is required when using shared key authorization.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException thrown if parameters fail the validation.
     * @return a Single which performs the network request upon subscription.
